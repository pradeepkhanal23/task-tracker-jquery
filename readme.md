# Task Management System

## Overview

The Task Management System is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, organize them by status (To Do, In Progress, Done), and set due dates for each task. Tasks are visualized as draggable cards that can be moved between different status lanes.

## Features

- Create new tasks with a title, description, and due date.
- Organize tasks into three status lanes: To Do, In Progress, and Done.
- Visualize tasks as draggable cards with dynamic styling based on due dates and status.
- Delete tasks individually with a click of a button.
- Responsive design for seamless usage across devices.

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
